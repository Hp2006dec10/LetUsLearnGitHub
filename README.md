### Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system and GitHub is a platform to host all the files relating to any version. 

### Stages of Git

- Untracked files
- Staging environment and tracking
- Commit in local repository
- Push into remote repository

### Branches of Git

Branches are a special feature to work simultaneously and this feature enables for groups to work together. In branch, from a specific commit point, a separate branch is created and any change in the branch will not be reflected in the main. At last, branch can be merged with the main when the user feels that all the issues have been solved in the branch.

### Objective

- To create a file in main and push to the remote repository.
- To create a branch, have a file, create manual file in the GitHub, handle push conflict, and then push it into the branch.
- Make a pull request and bring the file from branch into the main branch.
